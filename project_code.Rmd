# We will first run a package to read data into R.

library(haven)

# there is also a package "foreign" that was showned in class, but "haven" works better. 
# For this projedct, I will use GSS2016. GSS2016 was downloaded from this link:
# http://gss.norc.org/Documents/spss/2016_spss.zip

# The datafile was placed in work folder and loaded:

gss <- read_dta("GSS2016.DTA")
###################### 1. Working with data #################

# View the dataset using this command:

View(gss)

# Find out the variable names using this command

colnames(gss)

#Refer to the GSS codebook for what's in each variable.

head(gss$health, 10) #displays the first 10 observation for the variable health
head(gss$region, 10) #dipsplas the first 10 observation for the variable region.

# Let's look at some descriptive statistics for our two variables. Given that both
# are categorical it doesn't make sense to look at mean, median or quantiles.
# We can plot some figures to visualize disbrution, however. For instant histograms.
